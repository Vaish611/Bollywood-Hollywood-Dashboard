# Bollywood-Hollywood-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a Power BI data analysis dashboard created to understand business performance using real-world data. The main goal of this project is to convert raw data into meaningful insights that can help in better decision-making. I focused on analyzing trends, patterns, and performance across different dimensions like time, category, and region. This project helped me strengthen my data cleaning, modeling, and visualization skills using Power BI.

## KPIs Questions
1.How is the overall performance changing over time?
2.Which category or segment is contributing the most to total revenue?
3.Which products or services are performing the best and the worst?
4.Which region or location generates the highest and lowest sales?
5.What are the key trends and patterns visible in the data?
6.Are there any seasonal or monthly fluctuations affecting performance?
7.Which areas need improvement to increase overall business growth?

## Process
I started the project by understanding the dataset and identifying key columns required for analysis. After that, I cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query to handle missing values and improve data quality. Then, I created relationships between tables and built measures using DAX for calculations like totals, averages, and growth. Finally, I designed an interactive dashboard using charts, filters, and slicers to make insights easy to understand.

## Project Insights
From this dashboard, I was able to identify clear trends and patterns in the data. Certain categories and regions were consistently performing better, while some showed a decline and needed attention. The analysis also revealed seasonal patterns and key contributors to overall performance. These insights can help stakeholders focus on high-performing areas and take action on weak segments.
